"""Model-visualization traces — one pluggable module per model family.

Each module here teaches ONE family by fitting a small stand-in model on the REAL data and
returning a staged trace: the data table -> a training view -> a per-row testing walkthrough.
The frontend mirror lives in ``apps/web/components/model-viz/`` (same family names).

Plug IN a family: add ``<family>.py`` with ``@register_tracer("<family>")`` on a
``(X, y, feats, target, task, labels) -> ModelTrace`` function — discovery is automatic,
no other file changes. Plug OUT: delete the module (requests for it fall back to "trees").
