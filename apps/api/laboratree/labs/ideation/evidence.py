"""Evidence Hunt — turn a conceptual hypothesis into a cited, synthesized evidence brief.

Flow (all dependencies injectable, so it runs fully offline in tests):
  1. plan_queries  — LLM turns the hypothesis into a few targeted web queries
  2. search        — web_search (Brave→SerpAPI) gathers related papers / studies / articles
  3. synthesize    — LLM reads titles+snippets and writes a comprehensive brief: what the evidence
                     says, whether it supports / refutes / is mixed, the key findings, insights,
                     the variables worth testing, and the gaps — every claim tied to numbered sources.

The user brings the conceptual hypothesis; this does the reading and returns something to reason with
(and to hand to the auto-experiment stage next). Search misses degrade gracefully to an empty brief.
