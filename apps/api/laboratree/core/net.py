"""Outbound-request safety (SSRF guard).

Several agent features fetch URLs that originate from web-search results, the LLM, or paper text —
untrusted input. Without a guard, a crafted URL (http://169.254.169.254/ cloud-metadata,
http://localhost:5432, an internal 10.x host) could make the server exfiltrate secrets or reach
internal services. `is_public_http_url` resolves the host and only allows http(s) to a globally
routable address, blocking loopback/private/link-local/reserved ranges.

Residual risk: DNS rebinding (host resolves public here but flips before the socket connects) — a
known, advanced attack; mitigating it fully needs connection-time IP pinning. This guard stops the
common, high-impact vectors and is the right first line for launch.
