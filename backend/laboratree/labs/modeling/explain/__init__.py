"""Model explainers — beginner-first "learn this model from zero" content, one per family.

For someone meeting a model name (XGBoost, logistic regression, k-NN…) for the first time, each
explainer gives: a plain one-liner + analogy, how it works step by step, every key formula with each
SYMBOL explained in plain words AND a worked example that plugs in real numbers, a tiny example table,
when to use it / what to watch out for, and reference articles to go deeper.

Curated (not LLM-generated) so it's accurate, consistent, and free. Families mirror the viz registry
(`labs/modeling/viz`) and the frontend `modelKind()` map, so every registered model resolves to one.
